This extension lets you run the Web Applications saved by Epiphany/GNOME-Web
from a panel menu. It can also handle many profiles and show them as submenus,
if you so desire. A setup application is provided to help you to eventually
tweak these and more advanced settings.

In case you didn't get your copy of this extension from github, you can find its
